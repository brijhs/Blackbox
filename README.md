Blackbox Data Querying and Analysis for Arcadia Summer Research Program 

ErrorParse.csv is a table of the search terms used to standardize the data for errorParse() in the main notebook 
GPT_Fixes.csv is the table of grades assigned to the 99 samples of the five errors tracked in this study 
The main notebook does all the analysis; it queries the data, calculates time to fix, then produces the graphs and figures used in the report 
poetry files are just helpful to sort out dependency issues
